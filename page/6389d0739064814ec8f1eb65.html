Our mission is to make the metaverse a reality and our vision is a decentralized virtual world built and owned by its citizens.

We have been working towards this mission for a decade. We are the creators of Highrise, the first virtual world on mobile, which has seen extraordinary growth over the last few years and now boasts over 20 million users across iOS and Android. Every day, the citizens of Highrise come together to hangout, explore, create, collect, and trade in our metaverse, and we are on the precipice of making history once again with our expansion into Highrise World.

Highrise Social. The connecting social fabric of our world, this allows our users to meet and connect with each other in brand new ways not possible with any other virtual world.

Mentor and develop fellow engineers on the team

Design systems and services that are scalable and resilient

Collaborate with passionate, Engineers, Product Managers, and other Highrise team members, cross-functionally

To be successful in this role, we&#39;d expect you to…

Exceptional C# design and programming skills with at least 5 years of software programming experience

You must also have at least 3 years of experience in programming with the Unity engine

Experience shipping software at a professional level

Have experience architecting, designing, and implementing of a wide array of software products

Have experience supporting mission-critical applications at scale

Be able to work well in a remote development environment

You&#39;ll Love:
