              "description" : "<p>As a game economy designer, your job will be to collect as much input as possible about features that you design, and create clean, and well-balanced mathematical designs of new features, as well as rebalance and redesign the existing ones.

What you’ll do

Your work will consist of internal and external research, analysing player&#39;s data to create better designs, working with math designs in spreadsheets and/or code (over 50% of your work time), iterative balancing and playtesting the economy.

In return

You get paid well (4k-5k EUR net/month on b2b contract + VAT). But because we are our own masters (ok, not me, but the ones who actually do the paying) it all depends on what you bring to the table;

You can work 100% remotely from any country that is near our time-zone.

Benefits: paid holidays (26 days), training budget and some additional perks if you&#39;re located in Poland.

You will have lots of independence &amp; ownership. We trust that you have the skills to do your job well. There won’t be any micromanaging. That’s a promise.

You

You have at least 2 years of experience with F2P game design on mobiles, with a strong focus on economy. Preferably with mid-core/hardcore titles;

Your math skills are good. To say the least;

Your written english is impeccable and you can have a conversation from time to time;

You don’t need a babysitter and you can take responsibility for your work.

About us

If you care about such things, you might like to know that at Rage Quit Games we have 130+ people on board right now with HQ in Kraków and 2nd office in Kiev.
