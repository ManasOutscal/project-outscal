Who You Are:

You should have a deep understanding of game client technology and how that meshes with the server, and be able to deal with any challenge. You can speak game design with designers and confidently prototype ideas and then make the transition to solid, production code. You are passionate about developing games and working with others to shape the continued growth of the company and its culture.

Our team is small and you will be expected to take a significant part in improving the team&#39;s technology and engineering practices as well as implementing features. Day to day you&#39;ll be involved in evaluating design proposals for technical feasibility, working on features with designers, fixing bugs and reviewing code. You should expect to be working on aspects of the game that are as diverse as, developing an intuitive interface with the UX designers, to making gameplay features run faster.

How you&#39;ll contribute:

Collaborating with the design team to create a fun game by quickly prototyping in code to evaluate options

Writing rock solid gameplay code to help implement features from controls and UI to AI logic

Helping to optimize features to ensure that the game runs smoothly on all supported hardware

Explaining complex problems clearly and presenting potential solutions with their advantages and disadvantages

What you’ll need:

Experience of releasing a commercial iOS or Android title using Unity

Bachelor’s degree or better in Computer Science or equivalent experience

A deep knowledge of Unity and especially its GUI system

The ability to write well-structured and optimal code in C#

A broad knowledge of game engineering concepts including but not limited to: UI, AI and graphics

Awareness of the constraints faced by a mobile game and the impact they have on architecture

Desire to work in a creative, inspired start-up environment

A passion to continue to improve yourself and those you work with
