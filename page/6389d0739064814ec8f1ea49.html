You’ll be tasked with planning, constructing and maintaining the balance of in-game economies, including in-game resources, time allocations, item amounts and categorisations, in-game reward yields, IAP pack contents, and more as it’s required! You will have a direct impact on how the game feels and plays!

Put simply, if there’s a number associated with a feature, and that number is going to directly or indirectly affect the in-game economy and balancing, then you’ll likely be involved! If you’re amazing with numbers and an avid gamer with development experience, this role is for you!
