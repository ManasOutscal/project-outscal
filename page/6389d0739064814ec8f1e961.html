You should be proficient in Maya or Blender, Zbrush, Photoshop, and Substance Designer. You should also be excited about working in a developing proprietary engine and quick to pick up new software when the need arises. You need to be familiar with the full game development pipeline, and isn&#39;t afraid to problem solve and pick up tasks that might be out of your comfort zone. Having the ability to quickly create rough block-ins that focus on establishing gameplay feel and mood, then refine to a beautiful polished quality is a must.

Our team doesn&#39;t work like most companies and we shift gears a lot throughout development, so you should be adaptable and flexible. Instead of official meetings, we tend to have organic discussions throughout the day (in-person and online), so you should have great communication skills. Be prepared to revise work as needed and quickly incorporate feedback. This position works closely with other Artists, the Art Lead, and the Designer, so being an excellent collaborator is a requirement. Our team is very small, and people have a lot of individual responsibility over our games, so you should be self-motivated, proactive, and ready to take initiative.

Must have/be:

Strong understanding of artist and game development pipeline

Ability to collaborate effectively with other Artists, Art Lead, and other team disciplines

Ability to do your own research and concepts (in 2d or 3d) as needed

Desire to learn new techniques that increase art quality and efficiency

Ability to learn a proprietary engine

Strong grasp of Maya or Blender, ZBrush, and Photoshop

Experience with Substance Designer is a plus

Ability to create stylized artwork (and adapt to new styles)

Proactively document knowledge and share practices

What a day might look like…

Check in with Art Lead/Team about pressing needs

Work on current art tasks

Take input/direction from Art Lead concerning specific objectives/goals/tasks required for the project

Consistently and succinctly report any bugs to programming team

Consider ways to work better and more efficiently

Present and iterate based on feedback; provide insightful feedback to other art team members

Repeat

Location:

While this role is remote, we expect you to join us for in-person in meetings in Denver, CO. for 1 week every 3 months. We also ask that your working hours have at least a few hours of overlap time with the team.</p>",
