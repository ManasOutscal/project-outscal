Some of our crafters have worked together from PS1 to PS5 and will tell you about carving games one triangle at a time from punch cards.

We are some of the folk behind Spider-man, Tony Hawk, Lord of the Rings, Twitch Sings, Oddworld, Shrek Super Slam, and dozens of mobile and web games. We believe every member of the team has a voice in what the game should be.

We prioritize community, family, and love-of-gaming over process, crunching, and TPS reports. And maybe that’s what you want too.

We need an experienced network engineer who has previously worked on self-hosted multiplayer console titles. Particularly relevant experience includes distributing the server workload around all of the players, and experience providing movement correction for custom physics models. Unreal Engine experience is a bonus. The ideal candidate will work well with a team, and have shipped console titles. Depending on the candidate, this might be a lead role, principal role, or senior role where you help run the engine team (as opposed to our tools / gameplay teams). There&#39;s a bit of overlap. You&#39;ll report to the Tech Director.

Potential Responsibilities:

Development of system to share server workload across all players

Development of movement component for custom physics models

Optimization of network bandwidth throughout the title

Fixing networking edge-case defects

Advising gameplay teams on best way to structure code for network performance

Quality of life improvements on workflows.

PS5, XSX specifics.

Making a great game.

Qualifications:

Strong C++,

Network engineer on a Console multiplayer title

Experience with self-hosted (serverless) title

Shipped a game as the network engineer

Know the best pipelines for current hardware / network architectures.

Desirable Experience:

Unreal Engine

Co-op gameplay

Bandwidth optimization

High ping-time optimization

Vector math / calculus
