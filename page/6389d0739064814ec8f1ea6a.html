Are you passionate about designing and balancing across a range of different systems including combat, itemization and character progression?

Our team at Stoic, a 4-time BAFTA nominated independent video game company, is seeking a Mid-level or Senior Systems Designer. The person successful in this position will collaborate closely with the design, engineering and narrative teams to guide the development of features, systems and tools to help create content and features.

While driving multiple systems and features which bring the world of the game to life they will also have an in-depth knowledge of the technical realities and constraints of the engine, so they can provide clear feedback in design discussions regarding how they will improve development.

Your ability to communicate clearly and break down complex systems and designs into parsable chunks that non-Systems Designers can understand will be critical to your success.

What You Will Do:

Working with ARPG to define all the specific weapons, gear and aspects

Loot and reward allocation

Maintain and implement content and data for major gameplay systems using established tools

Scaling enemy difficulty

Understand metrics and react to them

Participate in the game design process at all stages from inception to completion

Provide feedback and input

Establish a deep personal understanding and investment in the game

Collaborate closely with other designers, artists and programmers

Exhibit flexibility in a small team setting that sometimes requires people to work outside their assigned role

Need to Have:

Minimum of 4 years experience in the game industry

Expert level proficiency in Excel or Google Sheets to build systems and models

At least one shipped title as a Systems Designer

Detail oriented and quality driven

Passionate about learning

MMO or ARPG game experience

Dedication to high quality standards

Nice to Have:

Live game experience

Worked on a game with a live monetization system

Stoic has transitioned to a fully remote, forever remote workforce.

We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p>",
