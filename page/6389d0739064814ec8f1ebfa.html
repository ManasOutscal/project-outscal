Great, let&#39;s talk about ourselves quickly. We&#39;re ambitious game enthusiasts who are well prepared to both have fun and work hard. We aim high, but we do not lose ourselves in the pursuit of success and further achievements. We love to learn! And over the years in the industry, we have learned that the best games are created by qualified, rested, treated with respect game developers.

Importantly, our work culture has been built on the basis of specific, true (and respected by us) values. The most important of these is &#34;We never lie&#34;, so you can be sure that we have not overdone this announcement. We play by our own rules and we make games that we would like to play ourselves. We combine the game development world with best software delivery practices to make it more predictable and reliable. All this helps us to bring fun back to game development! Will you help us?

Where do we stand on diversity?
