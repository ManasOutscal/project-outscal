This is either a permanent position (UK) or contract position (worldwide), with your current main role being as vehicle coder for our 3D driving game: Transmission. With feedback from our Design Director and alongside our Lead Designer, you will need to make driving our cars feel perfect. This is not just about pure simulation, but also about understanding user experience and how to tune that model to create satisfying vehicle handling.

You will be coding ‘everyday’ style road cars, in particular those from the 1980s. This includes car types such as standard 5-doors, estates and 4x4s, and larger vehicles like vans and lorries. Maybe even a 3-wheeler if you’re brave enough!
