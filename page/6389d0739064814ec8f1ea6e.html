              "description" : "<p>Team17 is establishing an ambitious and exciting new stand-alone virtual studio dedicated to the further development and on-going support of Hell Let Loose.

Hell Let Loose is a WW2 platoon-based realistic multiplayer FPS videogame for PC and consoles set during the Second World War. With over 6 million players already, this is just the start for us!

Team 17 is on the lookout for talented Game Designer who can bring their skills and creativity to this exciting and successful franchise.

This is a highly collaborative role, where you will be operating proactively alongside a mixed team of coders, artists, and game designers.

You have the technical and communication skills to communicate your ideas with your peers and the wider team.

Things you will do…

The communication and championing of Hell Let Loose’s game content, concept and vision to artists, programmers, producers, marketing staff and all others involved in the development process

Assist in the implementation of that content, and the balancing of key systems to the high quality of that content

Working proactively with the other members of the team, directors, and stakeholders, to ensure that the design-related goals of the project are met in a timely manner

Help ensure a high quality of work on their assigned project, primarily from a game design point of view, but also sometimes including UI/UX work

Presenting Hell Let Loose content to; press, or other development partners, either on Team17 premises, at the offices of platform holders, or at trade shows

Forming new ideas to contribute to both titles that are in development, and as the basis for ideas for wholly new games and IP

How you will do it…

Utilise excellent communication skills and the ability to write clearly and concise documentation to demonstrate new ideas and concepts to the team.

Engage concept ideation skills to hone and improve new features and concepts.

Identify what is essential to the game&#39;s core experience.

Employ their good interpersonal skills - the ability to work with people and accept feedback and criticism throughout development

Demonstrate prioritisation and time management skills; being able to work to deadlines but remaining committed to delivering a high level of quality

Utilise their strong practical knowledge of current game development practices and tools - including but not limited to game engines (for example Unity or Unreal), Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office, including experience of using scripting languages such as C# or Blueprint

Your Benefits…

Annual Bonus, Pension matched up to 8%, Share match Scheme, £1000 of free shares for all new colleagues.

BUPA private medical insurance including cover for pre-existing conditions and BUPA Dental

Work Anywhere. Whilst our studio is virtual you have access to utilise our three UK offices.

Team17 is an equal opportunities employer with a commitment to building a diverse workforce, representative of the world we live and game in! Accessibility is at the heart of our games, and we reflect that in how we operate as a business. Should you require adjustments or flexible arrangements to interview, or take up a role at Team17, please let us know in the notes section of your application and we will accommodate to the best of our ability</p>",
