We can’t create our mobile games without you! The engineering team at A Thinking Ape is eager to welcome you as their new teammate! This position is remote across Canada. You will write code in Python, Java and Objective-C to build new features for mobile games with massive amounts of concurrent users! One of our company values is ownership, so you’ll have the responsibility for your own game features. You’ll work directly with engineers, game designers, artists, and community managers to respond to game metrics and players, release new content and help run in-game events. At A Thinking Ape you’ll find challenging problems, a strong collaborative team, and supportive leadership.

Have you…

worked 4+ years post-graduation in a professional setting?

worked on a live mobile product?

worked on both frontend and backend?

built scalable backend services?

You may even have tried…

working with event-driven architectures, distributed systems, or database optimization

using whiteboarding and diagramming to design highly-scalable architectures

If the above describes some of the things you enjoy, we’d love to hear from you. Here’s a quick video clip of what we do at ATA.

About us:

Our teams are friendly, open to challenging themselves and everyone&#39;s ideas are heard based on our core value of having wonderful arguments. Our people leaders work with us individually to support our development, keep growing is another of our core values.

We’re working remotely across Canada, we’ll supply the equipment you need to do your work, and stipends to set up your workspace. We have a very flexible work schedule, three weeks of vacation, unlimited sick days, and a generous health benefits package. Our full story is here.
