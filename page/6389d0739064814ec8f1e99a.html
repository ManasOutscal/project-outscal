Your Mission:

We are actively recruiting a Senior Artist to help MPG deliver expert art support to our R&amp;D team.  You will work with the art/animation/tech art team and alongside production, design, QA and engineering teams in helping to deliver the best multiplayer experiences in the world.

You are an experienced Senior Game Artist who has delivered significant contributions to many games. You are an expert in your field with an arsenal of direct experience to call upon. You could be considered a Generalist, being experienced in multiple areas of game art development, 3D, 2D, animation, materials/shaders, VFX and maybe more. You have a desire to explore &amp; experiment in your craft, with a can-do attitude towards problem solving. You can operate independently on projects and demonstrate the full capabilities of your craft, understanding the technical as well as creative challenges. You’re happy to help mentor more junior artists and work collaboratively across the team to ensure the best possible ideas are professionally presented and realised in-game.

You fully understand that your art skills will only get you so far when it comes to creating solutions and that your other non-technical skills, such as effective communication, mentoring, and teamwork are starting to play a much larger role in your work.

Maintain high quality standards and process: workflows, tests, documentation, approvals

Assist more junior team members in day-to-day work, being proactive in sharing your knowledge

Attend stand-ups, craft meetings, deep-dives, reviews, show and tells, etc

What we&#39;ll need from you:

Senior Artist level portfolio/showreel

Experience using Unreal Engine &amp; Unity

Solid art development experience: having worked on multiple titles on all stages of game development

Attention to detail with a strong ability to analyse and comprehend visual direction and adapt style as needed

Solid problem solving: a knowledge of workflows, dependencies, typical challenges across multiple areas of art for games

Excellent knowledge of typical art tools and game engines

A good communicator with the ability to verbalise conceptual thoughts and the willingness to accept constructive critique

What would help:
