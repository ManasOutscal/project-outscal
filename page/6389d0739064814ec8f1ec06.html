About Bright Star Studios We are crazy ambitious. That’s one of the reasons why Ember Sword is created on our own custom game engine. The game should be playable via a browser and it is a matter of seconds from you entering our site until you are ingame. If you want to play in another region, you don’t need to start from scratch. You’ll simply have all your gear, levels, and items with you - This means you can always play with your friends, regardless of what server you both started on. No more annoying scenarios where you have to make new characters or pay to move to another server. All your skins are owned by the players, not the gaming companies. All cosmetics are dropped in-game as free NFT’s, allowing the player to truly own it, and enables them to legally trade assets outside the game. Cosmetics have zero in-game advantages and you can not pay to win. It’s free to play and it’s a game by gamers, to gamers. We are able to proudly state that, as our team consists of former professional Counter-Strike and World of Warcraft players.

Everyone is invited: Because together we are better. It&#39;s our policy to provide equal employment opportunities for all applicants and members of Bright Star Studios. We know that fresh and varied perspectives will make us better at what we do, so however you identify and whatever background you bring with you, we&#39;re excited to hear from you.
