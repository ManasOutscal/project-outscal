Our members range from industry newcomers to experts with 25+ years of experience. Team members come from a diverse set of backgrounds, but share a common passion for building polished player-focused, community-powered games.

At Hypixel Studios we are looking for applicants that are demonstrably passionate about their hobbies, have the drive and commitment to deliver results with minimal supervision, have international-level professional competency in their skill sets, and can demonstrate involvement with other interesting projects throughout their lives.

As a Principal Producer within Core Tech, you will be instrumental in playing a key role in our success. You will help drive priority and vision of key technical programs, powering all of Hytale’s various gameplay experiences and groundbreaking creator tools. You will work closely with teams of engineers while you collaborate across tech teams and leaders to help bring Hytale to life.

Who you are:

Experienced technical leader with exceptional prioritization skills and experience

Exceptional ability to decipher technical needs from stakeholder feature expectations and requirements

You have deep technical knowledge in highly creative projects

A strong leader with integrity that consistently pushes for high standards to achieve goals whilst supporting your team

Passionate about driving and delivering scalable and efficient core technical solutions

Experienced as an Agile Product Owner for highly technical products

Can think like a customer, understanding needs and requirements, ensuring that technical solutions are focused on enhancing the customer experience

Able to communicate the intent behind plans and decisions

As an excellent communicator, you are authentic and transparent in helping players and team members understand the decisions we make as developers

Some of your role:

Act as a Product Owner for the Core Tech team, scoping, prioritizing and defining delivery standards. You will own the vision and deliveries for the Core Tech team.

Working with stakeholders to create, update and refine complex technical roadmaps

Build and lead highly technical, geographically diverse teams

Collaborate frequently with leads of product teams, identifying and selectively investing in opportunities where Core Tech can enable those teams to best serve the Hytale audience.

Act as the main contact for Hytale’s core technology team, as it relates to the scope and design of our technical architecture, and future state.

Essential Traits:

8+ years of experience leading highly complex technology teams, in a creative environment

Experience with Agile development as a Product Owner

Ability to work across all areas of the product, understanding feature and delivery implications with all major technical decisions

Bonus Traits:

Experience shipping titles across multiple platforms (PC, console, mobile)

Experience with voxel, sandbox, or open world games

A personal passion for open world, builder, or survival games

We can offer:

A chance to work on a new game project with an extremely motivated team

Opportunities to learn and grow personally and professionally

A stable and secure work environment

The ability to work remotely

We’re looking for applicants who are self-driven, put players first, and that have a history of making cool stuff. In return, we can offer an environment that values and supports individual creativity and passion and believes in fostering new talent. We recognize the value of diversity in every sense and actively encourage candidates from diverse backgrounds to apply.</p>",
