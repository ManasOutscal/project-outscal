              "description" : "<p>Deep Silver Volition has been creating wildly original and successful video games for over 25 years, including the fan-favorite Saints Row series. Our studio has prospered by making fun, innovative games no one else can make, while focusing on work-life balance and fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous growth, and learning.

We’re currently seeking experienced Project Managers for several early-stage development teams. As a Project Manager at Deep Silver Volition, you’ll be responsible for the project schedules, collaborating closely with Producers, Project Directors, and Studio Leadership to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget, to established quality metrics. No prior video game experience is required – we’re looking for thoughtful communicators with experience leading cross-discipline software development teams in large-scale Scrum framework environments.

This is a remote-friendly role. We’re a hybrid work environment, headquartered in Champaign, IL but with employees working permanently remotely across the U.S. (We’re currently unable to hire in CA &amp; NY, unfortunately.)

What you’ll do as a Project Manager at Deep Silver Volition:

Own the full operational aspects of the team’s development process, including establishing development frameworks, reporting, risk management, capacity planning, and resource management.

Partner with internal stakeholders to establish the project and feature road map, evaluate staffing requirements, and manage prioritization of work.

Proactively identify project risks, issues, and triggers, establishing contingency plans as needed.

Ensure the project makes use of modern best practices regarding project management processes and frameworks.

Communicate regularly with key stakeholders to provide project status updates.

What we’re looking for:

3+ years’ experience as a Project Manager, Agile Coach, SCRUM Master, or similar, and have worked with or led a team through at least one full product cycle.

Experience managing two or more software development projects, including establishing project plans and budgets, determining task dependencies, assigning tasks, and implementing operational changes.

Demonstrated ability to create, manage, and maintain custom team reports using Jira, Confluence, Excel, Word, Microsoft Project, and other standard tools.

Aptitude for identifying and mitigating risks, taking appropriate steps to resolve difficulties, including changes to work methods, technologies, and project schedules.

Ability to manage conflict and build strong working relationships, across all levels of the organization.

An inspirational, team player mindset, always ready to share knowledge, communicate openly, and learn from others.

Proven communication and presentation skills, comfortable collaborating with a wide variety of stakeholders.

Some of our benefits:

Subsidized medical/dental/vision insurance

Company-paid life, short-term, &amp; long-term disability insurance

Generous paid time off (including parental leave and an annual company shutdown between Christmas &amp; New Year&#39;s)

401k with company contribution

Annual learning &amp; development budget + access to LinkedIn Learning

Paid subscriptions to Headspace, Doordash, Sworkit, and other wellness apps

At Deep Silver Volition we believe in fostering an open, collaborative, and diverse environment, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We will consider all qualified applicants without attention to race, color, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, genetic information, disability, age, veteran status, or military status. </p>",
