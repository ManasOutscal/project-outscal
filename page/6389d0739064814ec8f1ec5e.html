Our studio has prospered by making fun, innovative games no one else can make, while focusing on work-life balance and fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous growth, and learning.

This is a remote-friendly role. We’re a hybrid work environment, headquartered in Champaign, IL but with employees working permanently remotely across the U.S. (We’re currently unable to hire in CA &amp; NY, unfortunately.)

Volition is seeking an experienced Producer/Product Owner to join an unannounced project team. Working with the Production Leadership team, you&#39;ll help manage the game&#39;s product development life cycle, balancing product quality and innovation with project schedules, while managing competing priorities, feature scope, and team health. This is a great role for someone with a range of soft creative production skills, and enthusiasm for building and leading diverse and inclusive teams.

What you’ll do as a Producer at Deep Silver Volition:

Lead and collaborate closely with feature teams to drive product quality and timeliness, while ensuring alignment of creative vision and pillars throughout the entire process.

Foster a healthy team culture that rejects crunch while supporting each other to carry out ambitious goals.

Gather and coordinate milestone and development feedback with internal &amp; external development teams.

Help to identify project risks and develop mitigation plans, partnering cross-functionally with developers to resolve risks, bottlenecks, and inefficiencies.

Model proactive team communication, ensuring prompt dissemination of information and updates.

Partner with project management to ensure reliable team performance and deliverables, supporting creativity and building cohesive teams.

Ensures high quality by continuously playing the game, reviewing competitive products, evaluating design/technical/art documents and other creative materials, and creating quality tracking documents.

Schedule and coordinate meetings and ensure completion of action items.

Collaborate with Marketing and PR to support their efforts to promote the game while advocating for the development teams.

What we’re looking for:

3+ years&#39; experience developing video games as a member of a production team, preferably on AAA projects.

At least one shipped title for PC or console.

Persuasive and effective communication skills, with proven experience in diplomatically and effectively negotiating efficient solutions across cross-functional teams.

A resourceful and adaptive entrepreneurial spirit, with a bias for action.

Strong intellectual curiosity, willing to embrace experimentation and invite open participation in creative problem-solving.

A servant leader mindset, with a passion for enabling creative people to do their best work.

Working knowledge of Jira, MS Office, Confluence and testing applications.

Understanding of software development project management methodologies such as AGILE/Scrum.

Strong time management skills with a proven ability to focus on priorities, risk assessment, problem solving, handle multiple tasks and meet deadlines.

Proven ability to lead, connect with, and motivate all game development disciplines.

Some of our benefits:

Subsidized medical/dental/vision insurance

Company-paid life, short-term, &amp; long-term disability insurance

Generous paid time off (including parental leave and an annual company shutdown between Christmas &amp; New Year&#39;s)

401k with company contribution

Annual learning &amp; development budget + access to LinkedIn Learning

Paid subscriptions to Headspace, Doordash, Sworkit, and other wellness apps
