Some of our crafters have worked together from PS1 to PS5 and will tell you about carving games one triangle at a time from punch cards.

We are some of the folk behind Spider-man, Tony Hawk, Lord of the Rings, Twitch Sings, Oddworld, Shrek Super Slam, and dozens of mobile and web games. We believe every member of the team has a voice in what the game should be.

We prioritize community, family, and love-of-gaming over process, crunching, and TPS reports. And maybe that’s what you want too.

We need an experienced coder, who has a track-record of modifying Epic’s code inside of Unreal Engine. The ideal candidate will have created a number of improvements across a number of different systems, displaying fluency comprehending and then improving Epic’s design patterns. This role will entail getting a decent understanding of whichever subsystem we’re encountering problems with, and suggesting and implementing alternative solutions. This is unlikely to be graphics, networking or physics which have their own engineers. The ideal candidate will work well with a team and understand the architecture of current console hardware and know how to maximize performance on it. Depending on the candidate, this might be a lead role, principal role, or senior role where you help run the engine team (as opposed to tools / gameplay teams). You&#39;ll report to the Tech Director.

Potential Responsibilities:

Engine modifications to function better on our game design

Engine system replacement to function better with our game design

Quality of life improvements on workflows.

Guide gameplay / design / art decisions around problematic subsystems.

Profiling and performance.

Improve gameplay / design / art workflows.

Making a great game.

Qualifications:

Strong C++,

Multithreading

Experience creating major enhancement to UnrealEngine

Experience keeping created code in sync with Epic’s version upgrades

Shipped a console game using UnrealEngine

Degree in CompSci (or similar) or 10+ years industry experience

Desirable Experience:

3d Math

C#

Optimization for high core CPU

Work on Epic’s Cooking system
