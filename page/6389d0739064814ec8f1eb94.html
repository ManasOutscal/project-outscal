Mountaintop is a new game studio creating multiplayer games for teams that crave a challenge. We’re an independent, remote-first studio primarily located in the US and Canada.

We’re creating the types of games that bring people together — and keep them together for “just one more round.” The types of games that inspired us as kids. The games that become our hobbies, and sometimes our obsessions.

Games are a reflection of the teams that make them. So to make the best games, we’re building a studio that puts the team first — one that&#39;s collaborative, anti-crunch, diverse, and inclusive.

We’d love for you to join us.
