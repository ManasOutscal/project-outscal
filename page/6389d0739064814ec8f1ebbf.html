              "description" : "<p>We&#39;re looking for a talented and passionate Senior Site Reliability Engineer, to join Wildlife&#39;s SRE team in Brazil, Ireland, Argentina, or Uruguay.

As a SRE you&#39;ll play a key role in our infrastructure products&#39; development cycle, creating and deploying wide-reaching tools, frameworks, services, and pipelines to provide great infrastructure services to our games. You’ll work directly with our SRE’s and development teams to understand the project features, review technical designs, implement automations and quality measuring tools.

We know that the work we do has a high impact on our company&#39;s success and culture. The right person for this position is curious by nature, and comfortable in a “take the initiative” environment, loves solving problems, and can thrive in a fast and growing business.

What you&#39;ll do

Be part of a cross-functional team, directly contributing to feature development and maintenance of existing and new infrastructure services;

Develop, maintain and optimize infrastructure clusters (Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, MongoDB, Kafka…).

Define monitoring and observability patterns

Troubleshoot and manage incidents in production

Automate and improve infrastructure provisioning (Infrastructure as Code).

What you&#39;ll need

Solid knowledge in at least one programming language. We work mostly with Go and Python.

University degree in courses related to computing such as Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Systems, and Systems Analysis and Development or equivalent Market Experience;

Solid understanding of computer concepts (operational systems, networking, concurrency, memory management, and algorithm analysis);

More about you

Player focused. We are player oriented and infrastructure has a great impact in their experience. You have empathy with our players and focus on ensuring they have an amazing experience. You aim for a top-level infrastructure, guaranteeing the highest availability possible.

Automation is key to scaling. We look for engineers that have a history of projecting and executing automation projects in order to get rid of any manual and repetitive tasks.

Calm and pragmatism. When everything seems to be falling apart around you, you have a plan and keep calm.

Bleeding edge. You are curious and like to study new technologies, test new solutions and measure the impact brought by changes. We want to ensure we are using the best stack possible
