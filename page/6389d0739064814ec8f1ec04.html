Splitgate is a free to play, fast-paced sci-fi multiplayer shooter that combines the strategic elements of portals with the explosive gameplay of a first person shooter. We quickly became a top trending game on PlayStation, XBOX, and Steam. In our first 6 days, we passed 1M downloads, and hit 2M within the first two weeks. We’re now at 15M+ downloads and growing. After receiving $100M Series A funding with a valuation of $1.5B, we are actively looking to grow our team with the best talent out there to continue the journey of making Splitgate a game that we and the millions of players in our gaming community are proud of.
