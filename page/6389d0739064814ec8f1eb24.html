We’ve recently released Merge Magic! and we have more awesome projects in the pipeline. We do things differently here: we work in small self-managing teams, enabling you to have an incredible amount of ownership, autonomy and impact. We&#39;ll never ask you to abandon your craft and just focus on managing others or workload.

At Gram everyone is expected to have a razor-sharp focus on what creates tangible impact: impact on their team, impact on their work environment and impact on the overall company strategy. If you are motivated by autonomy, constant improvement, collaboration and the sense of belonging this is the right job for you.

We are looking for a new member to join our QA team at Gram Games to ensure top quality testing standards and processes are employed for all our releases giving our players experiences they love. You will independently lead a team’s test strategy and lead the end-to-end testing of everything related to your team. Fully embedded, you’ll be a pillar of great practice and knowledge for junior internal QA staff. You’ll already have built a toolbox of manual functional testing skills to apply to new project challenges.

Come join us! You’ll find a dynamic and engaging culture while having the opportunity to be a key component in the delivery of major features for a franchise title.

Set the standard for test estimations and coordination processes, knows what good internal &amp; external cohesion looks like and is confident at getting the most from vendor relationships.

Information, Reporting and Communication: Being adept at crafting tests that get the clearest results and then summarising that test data into useful, digestible, reports for the internal feature team to action. Knowing when an email report is more effective than an instant message and when a face-to-face is the way to go.

Decision making: Recognise the balance between quality and other business priorities; knowing the ROI of testing and how to navigate difficult project decisions.

Best Practice and Mentoring: Promoting QA best practices and running, mentoring and training for junior members of the internal and external QA teams. Represent QA during planning meetings and retrospectives.
