Position Summary

Crystal Dynamics is assembling a highly motivated, independent Incubation team. We are building an inclusive, diverse culture where every team member is valued for the perspectives and results we each bring to the table. We plan, act, and deliver as an indie team within the Crystal Dynamics group of studios. We are on the hunt for an experienced Enemy Designer. As an Enemy Designer you will be responsible for working with the team to plan, prototype and build enemies and bosses for a combat focused game. Design responsibilities include but are not limited to creating new enemies, enemy behaviors, giving direction and feedback to animators and artists regarding the enemies, and tuning the enemies. These responsibilities require a high degree of knowledge and experience between code and content, as well as showing demonstrable on-screen progress from concept to ship. Both theory and hands on work will be required.

Coordinate closely with AI programmers and Combat Level Designers to communicate the goals and specific needs of various combat systems and provide regular updates to all related gameplay systems

Under minimal supervision: design, adapt and scope features to the needs of production, the technical constraints of the project and the overall gameplay goals

Evaluate and initiate processes and features needed to improve and streamline any combat related production

Maintain, test, iterate combat system-based features from concept phase to final tuning

Document game mechanics and features quickly, clearly and concisely

Essential Requirements
