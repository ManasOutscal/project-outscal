About Ramen VR

Have you heard of Ready Player One? Well, we&#39;re building it for real people:

We&#39;re building the next reality featuring an infinite universe where millions of people can build new lives together in a gorgeous, cyberpunk and inspired world. We&#39;re starting with Zenith, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game that is cross platform for VR, desktop, and console.

Ramen VR was started in early 2019 in the Bay Area by Andy and Lauren, gaming tech engineers with decades of combined experience at Google, Unity, OpenFeint, and some very successful mobile and social games.

We&#39;re funded by some of the best investors and gaming entrepreneurs in the world including YCombinator, The Makers Fund, Twitch COO Kevin Lin, and Kabam Cofounder Holly Liu and also the most successful VR Gaming Kickstarter of all time.

We believe great games change the world for the better. Great games inspire creativity, teach grit, and most importantly, build community.

Why Work At Ramen VR?

Create the next reality

Every startup claims they are changing the world. How often do you find one that&#39;s building an entirely new reality? Also, we&#39;re such a small team, that you&#39;ll be working from and learning directly from the founders every day.

We Love Games

Have a favorite game coming out? Take a day off on launch day. We&#39;ll even buy you the deluxe version of the game. Play the game, and just do a short write-up to teach us what you learned. Want to attend PAX or E3? Once a year, we&#39;ll schedule a corporate trip for anyone who wants to go and hang out, while working together.

Work Remotely

Need to walk the dog, take care of your kids, or just want to live where you are? Work remotely from anywhere in the world.
