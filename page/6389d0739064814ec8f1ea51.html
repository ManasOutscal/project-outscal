Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre.

What started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding.

At 1047 Games, you’ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the world’s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our founders’ vision. Grit, ingenuity, a desire to have fun, and a start up mentality define our crew. We are currently working on a brand new shooter in the Splitgate universe.

What We&#39;re Looking For:

A expert designer: You love to take on difficult, seemingly impossible problems and dig in to find creative ways to solve them

A hard worker: You love to put in the extra effort, because you enjoy your work and know the impact of finishing the tasks at hand

Passion for gaming: You can recognize what separates exceptional games from the average ones. You understand the mindset of gamers which enables you to create and implement features that will further benefit the game

Responsibilities

Requirements

At least 5 years of professional experience in game design, with at least one shipped AAA title

Clear, analytical thinker, with a proven ability to break gameplay design down into regular, reusable systems and articulate and document them

Strong understanding of stat curves, player progression systems, and game play loops

Ability to identify, break down, and define core mechanics as well as implement quickly without sacrificing quality

Extreme attention to detail

Ability to adapt and cope with change as the production of the project demands

Must have the ability to conceptualize, present, and execute ideas within a schedule, while actively participating in technical and design problem solving in engine
