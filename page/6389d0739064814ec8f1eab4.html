              "description" : "<p>We are looking for a key senior designer to drive the gameplay and core systems for a combat-oriented VR real-time strategy game using the Unity engine.

Responsibilities

Advocate for design from the idea phase through implementation in the final game. Review features as they are implemented to make sure they are living up to the design goals and provide detailed feedback to help the game improve.

Plan out the design through documents which communicate the design needs of the game to all departments working on the game.

Work hands-on in the Unity editor to implement, refine, and balance gameplay.

Work with project and studio leadership to execute on the larger game vision.

Collaborate with our virtual team from your home office on the equipment we provide.

Work core hours in the North American Central time zone with the rest of our team.

Requirements

Experience shipping at least one commercially available game.

Experience with combat gameplay and the nuances that go into design and balancing it.

Strong knowledge of strategy games and the ability to design in that genre.

Experience creating design documents, whether text, spreadsheets, or 2D illustrations of gameplay systems and situations.

Skill at writing feature specifications for programmers, detailing how a system should work, how the player will interact with it, and what should be exposed for the design team to work with and balance.

Hands on implementation experience working in game engines to configure, tune and balance gameplay directly in the build.

Strong knowledge of AI design and how AI systems work with gameplay.

Strong written and verbal communication means you can talk with any department to help a game come together.

Nice-To-Have Experience

We don’t expect our designers to be able to do everything, but it’s helpful if our candidate has experience in other areas. Any of the following experience is not required, but is a plus:

Experience working on a strategy game

Prior Unity or Unreal game engine experience

Prior experience with other 3D game engines

Experience working in VR

Scripting/Programming - visual and/or text-based

Experience with level/mission design

Game narrative experience

Game art experience

To Apply:

If you meet most of the criteria, we want to hear from you! We believe in growing and training people. We need you to be able to do the job, but there is still room to add some new skills to your repertoire.</p>",
