That simple statement is at the heart of what we do here at Possibility Space. Founded by a diverse and experienced team of game and media industry veterans, we are built from the ground up as a distributed studio, allowing developers to live and work where they are happiest. We strive to create an environment where we can do our best work regardless of what we look like, who we love, or how we identify. With support operations in New Orleans, Louisiana, the studio also works to identify, mentor, train, and hire individuals from underserved and overlooked communities and backgrounds.

As a Senior Producer, you&#39;ll work closely with the Production Director and leads to create &amp; maintain a scaffolding of process to support our incredible development team as they collaborate, stay aligned, and reliably meet our commitments. Because strong collaboration makes the best games, you&#39;ll also work closely with all development disciplines to help shape and guide the game holistically through all stages of development.

Core Responsibilities &amp; Objectives

Working closely with the Production team and other leads to create and refine processes and project planning that allow the development team to produce ambitious work within constraints.

Facilitate scoping, planning, goal-setting, and dependency &amp; task tracking for a large cross-functional product area.

Use a mix of waterfall and agile tools for ensuring short- and long-term goals are met, problems are surfaced, and solutions are developed in partnership with everyone who has a stake in the outcome.

Support communication &amp; knowledge sharing across a fully distributed team with a consistent cadence and lightweight tools.

Core Traits (Skills, Knowledge, Experience)

Strong understanding of game development cycle from pre-production to release &amp; live operations

Solid experience with short- and long-term planning, and with agile methods for task and workflow management.

Supportive collaboration skills working across many disciplines and experience levels

Excellent spoken and written communication

Bonus Traits

Experience implementing and managing agile methodologies

Experience with gameplay, game systems, and/or animation

Technical knowledge sufficient to engage with engineers and technical artists and participate in balancing technical requirements with product vision and schedule

Physical Requirements

Close vision to monitors and screens, consistently working on computer equipment such as keyboards and monitors, long periods of sitting

Reasonable accommodations can be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions
