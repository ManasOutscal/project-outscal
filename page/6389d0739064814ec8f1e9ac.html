Crystal Dynamics is looking for a Shader / Materials Technical Artist who has an eye for high-quality, “best in class” material creation for real-time PBR environments. This Materials TA will be working on a small but fiercely talented team to bring to life the key moments in our narrative stories, levels and experiences. The successful candidate will be able to create complex, highly-optimized node-based shader networks, and work closely with artists to ensure derived materials instances are intuitive to work with.

Essential Duties &amp; Responsibilities

Create a collection of parent / base materials from which the environment, character, and VFX teams will derive their material instances

Develop workflows and pipelines to support the efficient creation of textures and material instances by the content team

Work closely with Engineering, Art, and Technical Art to drive new technical features and improvements to visual fidelity, helping to realize the Art Director’s artistic vision for the game

Set standards for material instance creation, including PBR value compliance and optimization best practices

Guide artists in proper creation of layered materials and help troubleshoot any issues. Document workflows and best practices for material creation

Use debugging and profiling tools to solve technical material bugs, analyze materials for GPU performance, and manage memory usage

Mentor more junior Technical Artists

Communicate effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences, including productive feedback and brainstorming, creation / contribution to technical design documents, code documentation, and user documentation

Take on R&amp;D tasks and produce usable new features within time constraints

Essential Requirements

5+ years of experience in the game development industry on AAA console titles (or relevant industry) with at least one shipped title (or relevant projects)

Experience writing shaders, either using a node-based graph or writing HLSL directly, including knowledge of best practices for GPU performance

Expert knowledge of PBR, advanced rendering techniques, shading models, and the relationship between materials and lighting

Significant optimization and debugging experience with PIX, GPAD, Nsight, RenderDoc, and/or similar profiling software for both GPU and CPU

Portfolio:

A demo reel (approximately two minutes) showcasing best work from professional and personal projects

A breakdown of work done for each project presented in the demo reel, including a description of the original problem, an overview of the solution as well as technical details, explanation of contributions you were directly responsible for, and thoughts on shortcomings and possible future improvements

Source code, if you are able to share it! Ideally, provide a link to your github account

Bonus Skills &amp; Experience

Sound artistic judgment (composition, color, etc.) and an eye for quality

Experience creating materials with Substance Designer, Substance Painter, and Photoshop

Understanding of photogrammetry and scanning processes

Basic Python and/or C++ knowledge or willingness to learn
