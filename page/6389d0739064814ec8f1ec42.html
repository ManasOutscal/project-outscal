We work in small self-managing teams, enabling you to have an incredible amount of ownership, autonomy, and impact. In Gram, everyone is expected to have a razor-sharp focus on what creates tangible impact: impact on their team, impact on their work environment, and impact on the overall company strategy. We are on the lookout for a talented Senior Product Manager who thinks they could thrive in that environment.

As a senior member of the product team, you will be instrumental in keeping the ball rolling for your team. The ideal candidate has acute analytical skills and an in-depth understanding of free-to-play games. In this role, you will be responsible for helping to navigate a full free-to-play business model, and for discussing, advocating for, and helping determine which strategic elements are needed for the titles to be an ongoing success.

Gram is a data-driven company. In this role, you will work closely with the data team on investigations, analyses, and the game economy. But this role has a key human element, as well; you need to be able to help drive and motivate team members across all disciplines and to curate a positive and productive team culture. Ultimately, the ideal candidate is a multi-talented, flexible problem-solver who’s not afraid to roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty.

Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:

Working collaboratively with a range of disciplines to drive results and outcomes
Working with data to help validate/invalidate hypotheses about the game economy
Assessing the impact of potential improvements or changes on the game
Effectively communicating with different stakeholders &amp; teams &amp; offices
Above all, flexibility and adaptability are key

Requirements

Minimum of 3 years of experience in product management in consumer, mobile, or game development
Ability to create wire-frames, product specifications and white papers
Experience managing live mobile applications and/or games with multivariate testing is preferred
Exceptional data analysis skills
Strong project management skills and ability to present work to executive staff
Strong passion for games, creating fun, compelling and addictive user experiences
Outstanding written/oral, organizational, analytical skills, and attention to detail
Ability to provide clear direction, set measurable goals and give insight on industry trends
Previous start-up, social networking and/or consulting experience is a strong plus
Advanced Excel and SQL proficiency preferred
BA/BS degree, MBA preferred

Benefits

Competitive salary, bonus plan, Zynga RSU’s (Restricted Stock Units), ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan)
RRSP Company Match Contribution
Extended Health coverage, dental, disability, critical illness, EAP, and life insurance
Virtual mental health and neurodiversity support programs
Goodlife fitness annual membership
Open vacation policy
Family planning support program
Generous paid maternity/parental leave
Subsidized Back-up child care
Zynga happy hours and frequent employee events
