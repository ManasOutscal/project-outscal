We are in the amazing position of building strong dynamic teams across the business right now, going through our biggest period of growth we have seen to date with opportunities in both our Wakefield and Manchester studios.

Key aspects of working at Team17 are responsibility and impact. While we have the financial stability of a large studio, the actual work is carried out in small cross discipline teams. This allows you, personally, to have a big impact on every product you work on, encouraging you to grow your skills and knowledge as you solve a wide variety of challenges during development.

To support this journey, we have our internal training and mentoring system where you will be supported by your peers. With our “There are no stupid questions” mentality you are actively encouraged to seek out advice and help from other programmers across the studio, and you will in turn be helping them back.

This role is not suitable for entry level candidates, we are looking for candidates with a proven skillset and expeirence.

In this role you will be responsible for:

Planning, Writing and debugging code for project features to ensure they are delivered to the desired quality

Assessing project bug database for issues and being proactive to address them where necessary.

Work with other disciplines to understand their requirements and work proactively with them to ensure any limitations are clearly communicated and understood.

Assessing task/timings to assist in schedule production

Carry out assigned tasks within the time scheduled for them and reporting progress to your Lead Programmer and/or Producer

Requirements

The skills and experience you will need to apply for this role include:

A background of Games Development experience and a demonstrable passion for Games Development

Experience developing games with Unity, Unreal Engine or a custom engine

Experience with one or preferably both of the following languages: C++ or C#

Good understanding of the languages/engines you have worked with.

Good knowledge of software engineering practices

Good written and verbal communication skills to ensure clarity and accuracy of communication.

A passion to learn and further your own skill set and knowledge of developing games on a range of platforms – PC, Xbox One, PS4, Switch and more

Team17 is an equal opportunities employer with a commitment to building a diverse workforce, representative of the world we live and game in!

Accessibility is at the heart of our games and we reflect that in how we operate as a business. Should you require adjustments or flexible arrangements to interview, or take up a role at Team17, please let us know in the notes section of your application and we will accommodate to the best of our ability.</p>",
