                                    The game studio that made the critically-acclaimed game The Witness is looking for a highly experienced animator.

Animations should have excellent grasp of weight and balance

Animations should be smooth and natural

Animations should support fluid gameplay and feel responsive and snappy while maintaining style and intention

Create quick rough animations to try out ideas (and also to refine it into something highly nuanced, while also paying close attention to gameplay limitations)

Work in our established pipeline from Maya to our custom game engine, and fill in the gaps that have not yet been established

Make intelligent decisions relating to rigging, tools used, naming conventions, file/folder structure, etc

Game development experience is a must

Catch on to workflows and gameplay needs quickly; adapt to those workflows and needs; for example; create rough animations while problems are being solved

Work closely with other game artists and art lead; needs to be a solid collaborator

Needs to have initiative and be proactive

                                    Do you think about what a receiver would have to work and look like if it were fed from the magazine with lightning bullets? What about if you were harnessing the power of the sun, charging, and channeling it inside a rifle? Do you find yourself thinking about how the starboard wing of a spaceship would attach to the main fuselage if it had to repeatedly endure the stresses of re-entry, warp space, and orbital ascension? How would you sit on a rocket with gravity repulsors, hit the throttle, and have the whole thing not only hold together, but look good doing it?

We are right there with you, it is what drives us every day. Give us a shout, we want to hear from you. We are the makers of worlds, dreams, and amazing things, and we think you might fit in just fine.

What we’re looking for:

6+ years&#39; experience in the Character Art discipline, with 2+ years&#39; experience as a Senior or above in AAA game development.

Past leadership experience on at least one shipped AAA title.

Strong knowledge of anatomy, form, silhouette design, and detail hierarchy.

Deep technical knowledge of modern pipelines, workflows, and techniques for developing AAA characters.

A proactive drive to explore cutting-edge technologies and techniques for character development, and an interest in adapting new workflows and processes.

Exceptionally comfortable working within ambiguity and exploring new creative solutions.

Fluent knowledge of multiple major 3D and 2D packages (3DS Max or Maya, Zbrush, Photoshop, and Substance) and techniques for Characters, Creatures, and Costuming.

Demonstrated ability to provide feedback and mentorship to other artists, fostering a diverse and inclusive culture of positivity, enthusiasm, and continual development.

Strong understanding of a physically based workflow.

Experience working with a scanning pipeline.

Pluses:

                                    Are you on a mission to create games that bond players together into deeply invested communities? Would you like to work on something comedic with lighthearted and whimsical characters? Do you think a lot about how modular rigging systems enable quick iteration, how streamlined DCC pipelines empower artists, or how to achieve feature-quality character animation within real-time constraints?

As a Senior Rigging Tech Artist on an Unannounced Incubation Project, you’ll bring iconic characters to life from prototype through production for a completely new world at Bungie. Your ability to craft exceptional character rigs and efficient art workflows will delight animators and contribute to the best-in-class action experience that defines all Bungie games.

As a member of our tight-knit art team, you’ll balance craft expertise with a player-first mindset and willingness to contribute beyond your role to improve the prototype experience. Your understanding of animation and technical constraints will enable you to deliver functional and innovative rigs without an established pipeline during prototyping, and then to help us build that pipeline for production. Most importantly, you will work with a fun, diverse, and passionate cross-discipline team devoted to building a new universe from scratch at Bungie.

We look for candidates who value joining a mission-focused team with a diverse set of backgrounds, experiences, interests, and viewpoints.

Work closely with Animation to iterate on flexible character and creature rigs that support expressive, stylized movement &amp; appealing real-time deformation

Research, prototype, and create technical content for 3D assets (skeletons, skin weighting, rig components, etc.)

Collaborate with artists and engineers to build robust character workflows

Provide deskside support for artists, animators, and designers

Develop and maintain internal &amp; external tools pipelines to support artists working efficiently

Document best practices for creating technical content, as well as art-focused tools and workflows

Mentor and support other tech artists as the team grows

REQUIRED SKILLS

Professional or personal experience working with animated characters in real-time game engines

Proficiency at character and creature rigging in Autodesk Maya or equivalent software

Scripting or programming experience in Python, C#, C++, or equivalent

An appreciation for appealing squash &amp; stretch, smear frames, multiples

Outstanding ability to problem-solve and drive creative solutions despite ambiguity

Embrace “we” culture in addition to being an outstanding collaborator and communicator

NICE-TO-HAVE SKILLS

Experience with development using Unreal Engine or Unity

Generalist 3D art experience (modeling, UVs, etc.)

Familiarity with user-centered design principles

So you don&#39;t meet every requirement listed in this job description? Do you think your experience level is not where it needs to be? Studies show that women and people of color are less likely to apply to jobs unless they believe they meet every single qualification. Bungie is focused on building a diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplace. If you&#39;re interested in this position but your past experience doesn&#39;t line up perfectly with every qualification in the job description, we want you to apply anyway. The right role for you may be right around the corner!

Most Bungie full-time employees will adopt a digital first approach allowing remote work in Bungie approved locations (outside of positions identified as 100% onsite in Bellevue/Seattle, or individuals preferring a hybrid/flex environment). Prospective full-time employees located outside of CA, CO, DC, FL, GA, IL, MA, MD, MN, NC, NJ, NY, OR, TN, TX, UT, VA, WA, or WI will need to establish residency in one of the states we are compliant in within 45 days of a start date. Contractors will follow a digital first approach adhering to the location guidelines agreed upon by our third-party employer/vendor and Bungie. Bungie’s remote policy is subject to change at the company’s discretion.

Can you spare us another 30 seconds?

Great, let’s talk about ourselves quickly. We’re ambitious game enthusiasts who are well prepared to both have fun and work hard. We aim high, but we do not lose ourselves in the pursuit of success and further achievements. We love to learn! And over the years in the industry, we have learned that the best games are created by qualified, rested, treated with respect game developers.

Importantly, our work culture has been built on the basis of specific, true (and respected by us) values. The most important of these is “We never lie”, so you can be sure that we have not overdone this announcement. We play by our own rules and we make games that we would like to play ourselves. We combine the game development world with best software delivery practices to make it more predictable and reliable. All this helps us to bring fun back to game development! Will you help us?

Where do we stand on diversity?

                                    We are looking for a 3D artist to join our team working on a VR real-time strategy game using the Unity engine.

Responsibilities

Modify, repurpose, and optimize existing assets as necessary.

Import and set up assets in the Unity engine, then test them out in VR.

Work with an eye toward performance, keeping assets within budget, and meeting other technical specs. Collaborate with the team to profile problem areas and rework assets to consistently hit our target frame rate.

Work independently to solve problems and get your work done, but know when to collaborate to complete tasks more efficiently.

Correctly scope work and provide time estimates that you are able to hit to deliver key milestones.

Collaborate with our virtual team including other artists and the art lead from your home office on the equipment we provide.

Work core hours in the North American Central time zone with the rest of our team.

Experience creating game-ready 3D assets and textures

Knowledge of game art and best practices in game art creation

Experience in hard-surface modeling

Nice-To-Have Experience

Prior Unity engine experience

Prior experience with Unreal or other 3D game engines

Experience creating materials in Unity or other game engines

Experience working on VR titles

Experience with Substance Painter/Designer and Photoshop

To Apply:

If you meet most of the criteria, we want to hear from you! We believe in growing and training people. We need you to be able to do the job, but there is still room to add some new skills to your repertoire.

WHO WE ARE

At Fortis Games we aspire to make great games that bring people together while redefining how game companies work. We believe in building a sense of belonging through our games, their communities, and how we operate and treat each other. Through our game communities, we will create powerful connections and lasting memories. We will foster a culture of diversity, equity and belonging where together our diverse skills, experiences and background impact the games we make.

We are an early but mighty organization with a leadership team of game industry veterans. There are many opportunities for you to have a big impact on the products we’ll be making as well as the overall direction of the company. If you’re passionate about tackling difficult problems with direct and thoughtful communication and team first mentality, we may be the right place for you.

ABOUT THE ROLE (THE MISSION, WHY THIS ROLE EXISTS, THE THING YOU DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN)

Work with product leadership to design major systems and features for new game concepts.
Help direct and mentor other members of the product team.
Share learnings with the broader product team and contribute to the overall development of our product strategy and portfolio of games.

WHAT YOU’LL ACHIEVE (OUTCOMES VS WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO)

You will design core systems in our new games that are critical to their success by:
Creating proposals that articulate how these features and systems uphold the game’s design pillars and drive the desired player behaviors
Delivering clear, concise, and thorough specifications to cross functional teams responsible for implementing these systems
Providing team members with direction on how content should be created, tuned, and live operated within these systems
You will become an expert in the opportunity spaces, genres, and game mechanics you explore during prototyping and share your learnings with the broader product team to advance our collective knowledge.

You will develop an independent design philosophy that upholds the key tenets of Fortis’ approach to products while adding your own unique approach to thinking about emerging patterns in service design.


WHAT YOU’LL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL

A holistic view of game systems and the downstream effects of all design decisions throughout both the product and player lifecycle.
A firm understanding of fundamental design principles, metagame systems, game economies, and player psychology that allows you to design from first principles.
Ability to articulate the nuances of abstract concepts and how they apply to complex, interrelated systems.
Ability to synthesize feedback from team members, user playtests, and other validation efforts into product insights and rapidly iterate on designs.
Extensive knowledge of games as a service and live operations – you know what good looks like and can build efficient design processes, workflows, and tooling to enable it.
Enthusiasm for directing, mentoring, and otherwise elevating the people around you to do their best work.
A natural curiosity and eagerness to learn - we believe this is essential to our ability to stay ahead of the market and value this over years of experience.

We expect our leaders to continue being students of their craft and the game spaces they’re working in. You should be educated on the latest trends and have a strong perspective on how they relate to our current and future projects.

Want to work for a company that is actively trying to make a difference and change the world through video games and creative storytelling? We’d love to hear from you!

About the position:

E-Line is seeking a talented and experienced Open-World Level Designer to join our design team and help with the development of Never Alone 2.

Our ideal candidate has experience using Unreal to design and build compelling gameplay sequences, an understanding of open-world systems-based gameplay, and a broad experience with many open-world games.

As our Open World Level Designer, you will ...

Work with the Design Director, engineering, and environment art teams to create compelling, immersive game experiences. Collaborate with Production to ensure design work is planned and progressing as expected according to project goals.

Work with our Alaska Native partners to help make the game&#39;s world as authentic as possible to their culture and worldview.

We’re looking for someone who has …

Worked for several years building game experiences for open-world or heavily systemic games, including large-scale world design, quest design, and environmental storytelling.

Experience using a visual scripting language like Unreal’s Blueprint or other similar systems.

Well-versed with a variety of creative approaches in open-world multiplayer/co-op games.

Enthusiasm to collaborate and communicate with a team of other programmers, artists, and designers.

It’s a bonus if you have …

Shipped one or more games built with Unreal.

Experience with scripting a range of gameplay like camera sequences, narrative design, or contextual interactions.

Experience with multiplayer and/or cooperative games.

A love for innovative video games.

Top Reasons to Work with Us

Being part of an enthusiastic, diverse team who wants to make games with a positive impact.

Co-create an authentic game experience in collaboration with our Alaska Native partners.

A positive, healthy remote work environment with flexible hours. We promote a culture free from crunch.

We provide competitive salaries with full medical benefits and matching 401k, as well as paid paternity/maternity leave, vacation, holidays, and sick/wellness days.

About the project:

The first game, Never Alone, was developed by E-Line Media and the Cook Inlet Tribal Council (CITC), a pioneering Alaska Native organization, with the goal of sharing, celebrating, and extending Alaska Native culture with a global audience. The game explores a story passed down for thousands of years, is in the Inupiat language, and features 26 mini-documentary &#39;cultural insights&#39; that get unlocked through gameplay.

Never Alone has touched a nerve globally. It has been downloaded over 10 million times, featured in over 1000 articles, and won many awards, including a BAFTA and a PEABODY. The game is featured in museums around the world, including the Smithsonian and MoMa. CITC has converted their revenue in the game into equity in E-Line, and they&#39;re E-Line&#39;s largest shareholder, and their Chairman is the CEO of the Tribal Council.

We believe players are more than ready for their next adventure with Nuna and Fox, and we are excited to work on the sequel. The second game, Never Alone 2, will build on what players liked about Never Alone 1 (authentic culture, beautiful, evocative world, co-op gameplay with Nuna and Fox, spirit helpers, unlockable ‘insights’), now enabling them to go much deeper in terms of innovative gameplay and cultural exploration. NA2 will take players on a moving, spiritual journey through fun gameplay, developed inclusively with the Alaska Native community.

                                    Working closely with the Studio Lead Designer, you will set goals for in-game economy performance, work to meet those goals by working closely with the team - use of mathematical genius, excel wizardry and magic are all highly encouraged but not (officially) required - and report back regularly with both expected and achieved results.

You’ll be tasked with planning, constructing and maintaining the balance of in-game economies, including in-game resources, time allocations, item amounts and categorisations, in-game reward yields, IAP pack contents, and more as it’s required! You will have a direct impact on how the game feels and plays!

Put simply, if there’s a number associated with a feature, and that number is going to directly or indirectly affect the in-game economy and balancing, then you’ll likely be involved! If you’re amazing with numbers and an avid gamer with development experience, this role is for you!

Key Responsibilities

Plan and implement the balancing of our game economies across a growing roster of game genres.

Collaborate with our analytics team to collect and analyze economic data; build reports on performance, then suggest and implement new strategies and optimize existing performance.

Collaborate with the development team to implement economy data and test the results.

Create game economy simulations and evaluate their performance &amp; their impact on player experience.

Track and understand the Key Performance Indicators (KPI&#39;s) to develop and optimize game balancing accordingly.

What You Bring To The Role

Thorough knowledge of video games and game economies.

Ability to work in a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary, iterative environment, while delivering under deadlines and time constraints.

Knowledge of how player progression systems and economy systems interact.

Interest in playtesting, getting feedback, and giving feedback.

Bonus Points!

Scripting or programming experience.

Experience in game dev or game design.

                                    1047 Games began with the simple principle that people should have fun while making great games. Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre.

What started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding.

At 1047 Games, you’ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the world’s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our founders’ vision. Grit, ingenuity, a desire to have fun, and a start up mentality define our crew. We are currently working on a brand new shooter in the Splitgate universe.

What you’ll be doing

Working with the rest of the team to create prototypes and working products for the web.

Creatively exploring how we can push the bounds on a wide range of sub-disciplines in the creation space: product design, UX, brand design &amp; illustration, 3D design, animation, and video

Coming up with novel, groundbreaking ways of combining templates and tools to unlock even the most unskilled creators

What we’re looking for

A skilled product designer who is at the cutting edge of UI and new interaction paradigms

Background in web and mobile design, specifically creation tools

                                    WHO WE ARE

At Fortis Games we aspire to make great games that bring people together while redefining how game companies work. We believe in building a sense of belonging through our games, their communities, and how we operate and treat each other. Through our game communities, we will create powerful connections and lasting memories. We will foster a culture of diversity, equity and belonging where together our diverse skills, experiences and background impact the games we make.

We are an early but mighty organization with a leadership team of game industry veterans. There are many opportunities for you to have a big impact on the products we’ll be making as well as the overall direction of the company. If you’re passionate about tackling difficult problems with direct and thoughtful communication and team first mentality, we may be the right place for you.

ABOUT THE ROLE (THE MISSION, WHY THIS ROLE EXISTS, THE THING YOU DO OVER AND OVER AGAIN)

Work with product leadership to design major systems and features for new game concepts.

Help direct and mentor other members of the product team.

Share learnings with the broader product team and contribute to the overall development of our product strategy and portfolio of games.

WHAT YOU’LL ACHIEVE (OUTCOMES VS WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO)

You will design core systems in our new games that are critical to their success by:

Creating proposals that articulate how these features and systems uphold the game’s design pillars and drive the desired player behaviors

Delivering clear, concise, and thorough specifications to cross functional teams responsible for implementing these systems

Providing team members with direction on how content should be created, tuned, and live operated within these systems

You will become an expert in the opportunity spaces, genres, and game mechanics you explore during prototyping and share your learnings with the broader product team to advance our collective knowledge.

You will develop an independent design philosophy that upholds the key tenets of Fortis’ approach to products while adding your own unique approach to thinking about emerging patterns in service design.

WHAT YOU’LL NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL

A holistic view of game systems and the downstream effects of all design decisions throughout both the product and player lifecycle.

A firm understanding of fundamental design principles, metagame systems, game economies, and player psychology that allows you to design from first principles.

Ability to articulate the nuances of abstract concepts and how they apply to complex, interrelated systems.

Ability to synthesize feedback from team members, user playtests, and other validation efforts into product insights and rapidly iterate on designs.

Extensive knowledge of games as a service and live operations – you know what good looks like and can build efficient design processes, workflows, and tooling to enable it.

Enthusiasm for directing, mentoring, and otherwise elevating the people around you to do their best work.

A natural curiosity and eagerness to learn - we believe this is essential to our ability to stay ahead of the market and value this over years of experience.

We expect our leaders to continue being students of their craft and the game spaces they’re working in. You should be educated on the latest trends and have a strong perspective on how they relate to our current and future projects.

Understanding the needs of our designers who end up using these systems will be crucial to developing intuitive, efficient tools and workflows, maximizing the versatility and use of these features.

Beyond a deep understanding of programming and an eye for design, we are looking for a thoughtful collaborator who shares our excitement for learning, researching new techniques, wearing multiple hats and stepping outside of regular workflows to innovate and make things happen. A multi-disciplinary approach will be crucial as you help us find solutions to unforeseen challenges that we discover as we bring our next project to life.

Responsibilities

Advocate for design from the idea phase through implementation in the final game. Review features as they are implemented to make sure they are living up to the design goals and provide detailed feedback to help the game improve.

Plan out the design through documents which communicate the design needs of the game to all departments working on the game.

Work hands-on in the Unity editor to implement, refine, and balance gameplay.

Work with project and studio leadership to execute on the larger game vision.

Collaborate with our virtual team from your home office on the equipment we provide.

Work core hours in the North American Central time zone with the rest of our team.

Requirements

Experience shipping at least one commercially available game.

Experience with combat gameplay and the nuances that go into design and balancing it.

Strong knowledge of strategy games and the ability to design in that genre.

Experience creating design documents, whether text, spreadsheets, or 2D illustrations of gameplay systems and situations.

Skill at writing feature specifications for programmers, detailing how a system should work, how the player will interact with it, and what should be exposed for the design team to work with and balance.

Hands on implementation experience working in game engines to configure, tune and balance gameplay directly in the build.

Strong knowledge of AI design and how AI systems work with gameplay.

Strong written and verbal communication means you can talk with any department to help a game come together.

Nice-To-Have Experience

We don’t expect our designers to be able to do everything, but it’s helpful if our candidate has experience in other areas. Any of the following experience is not required, but is a plus:

Experience working on a strategy game

Prior Unity or Unreal game engine experience

Prior experience with other 3D game engines

Experience working in VR

Scripting/Programming - visual and/or text-based

Experience with level/mission design

Game narrative experience

Game art experience

                                    Want to be onboard a rocketship and help build a new and groundbreaking MMORPG called Ember Sword?

Senior Systems Engineer

As a Senior Systems Engineer on the Bright Star Studios engineering Team, you&#39;ll be part of the core Systems team You will work on creating new services, such as a social server, chat server, and other networked services that need to be built from the ground up in Golang.

We are expanding with rocket speed, while being on our quest to make the next big MMORPG. Generally, building something from scratch should excite you rather than terrify you. Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be doing this alone; throughout the last year our team grew by 125% and we have various backgrounds from companies such as Riot Games, Blizzard, Apple, Unity, Lucas Art, and so on. We have plenty of ideas and we are looking for more talented people to help us fulfill them.

Responsibilities:

Creating services like the chat service, database / persistence layer, social server etc.

Creating architecture proposals for new services and implementing them from the ground up.

Working with the network engineers to create optimized data flows

Work closely with DevOps to develop stable and reliable services

About Bright Star Studios We are crazy ambitious. That’s one of the reasons why Ember Sword is created on our own custom game engine. The game should be playable via a browser and it is a matter of seconds from you entering our site until you are ingame. If you want to play in another region, you don’t need to start from scratch. You’ll simply have all your gear, levels, and items with you - This means you can always play with your friends, regardless of what server you both started on. No more annoying scenarios where you have to make new characters or pay to move to another server. All your skins are owned by the players, not the gaming companies. All cosmetics are dropped in-game as free NFT’s, allowing the player to truly own it, and enables them to legally trade assets outside the game. Cosmetics have zero in-game advantages and you can not pay to win. It’s free to play and it’s a game by gamers, to gamers. We are able to proudly state that, as our team consists of former professional Counter-Strike and World of Warcraft players. Want to know more?

Some of our crafters have worked together from PS1 to PS5 and will tell you about carving games one triangle at a time from punch cards.

We are some of the folk behind Spider-man, Tony Hawk, Lord of the Rings, Twitch Sings, Oddworld, Shrek Super Slam, and dozens of mobile and web games. We believe every member of the team has a voice in what the game should be.

We prioritize community, family, and love-of-gaming over process, crunching, and TPS reports. And maybe that’s what you want too.

We need an experienced coder, who has a track-record of modifying Epic’s code inside of Unreal Engine.

This is unlikely to be graphics, networking or physics which have their own engineers. The ideal candidate will work well with a team and understand the architecture of current console hardware and know how to maximize performance on it. Depending on the candidate, this might be a lead role, principal role, or senior role where you help run the engine team (as opposed to tools / gameplay teams). You&#39;ll report to the Tech Director.

Potential Responsibilities:

Engine modifications to function better on our game design

Engine system replacement to function better with our game design

Quality of life improvements on workflows.

Guide gameplay / design / art decisions around problematic subsystems.

                                    Deep Silver Volition has been creating wildly original and successful video games for over 25 years, including the fan-favorite Saints Row series. Our studio has prospered by making fun, innovative games no one else can make, while focusing on work-life balance and fostering a culture of collaboration, continuous growth, and learning.

We’re currently seeking experienced Project Managers for several early-stage development teams. As a Project Manager at Deep Silver Volition, you’ll be responsible for the project schedules, collaborating closely with Producers, Project Directors, and Studio Leadership to ensure that projects are completed on time and on budget, to established quality metrics. No prior video game experience is required – we’re looking for thoughtful communicators with experience leading cross-discipline software development teams in large-scale Scrum framework environments.

This is a remote-friendly role. We’re a hybrid work environment, headquartered in Champaign, IL but with employees working permanently remotely across the U.S. (We’re currently unable to hire in CA &amp; NY, unfortunately.)

What you’ll do as a Project Manager at Deep Silver Volition:

Own the full operational aspects of the team’s development process, including establishing development frameworks, reporting, risk management, capacity planning, and resource management.

Partner with internal stakeholders to establish the project and feature road map, evaluate staffing requirements, and manage prioritization of work.

Proactively identify project risks, issues, and triggers, establishing contingency plans as needed.

Ensure the project makes use of modern best practices regarding project management processes and frameworks.

Communicate regularly with key stakeholders to provide project status updates.

What we’re looking for:

3+ years’ experience as a Project Manager, Agile Coach, SCRUM Master, or similar, and have worked with or led a team through at least one full product cycle.

Experience managing two or more software development projects, including establishing project plans and budgets, determining task dependencies, assigning tasks, and implementing operational changes.

Demonstrated ability to create, manage, and maintain custom team reports using Jira, Confluence, Excel, Word, Microsoft Project, and other standard tools.

Aptitude for identifying and mitigating risks, taking appropriate steps to resolve difficulties, including changes to work methods, technologies, and project schedules.

Ability to manage conflict and build strong working relationships, across all levels of the organization.

An inspirational, team player mindset, always ready to share knowledge, communicate openly, and learn from others.

Proven communication and presentation skills, comfortable collaborating with a wide variety of stakeholders.

Some of our benefits:

Subsidized medical/dental/vision insurance

Company-paid life, short-term, &amp; long-term disability insurance

Generous paid time off (including parental leave and an annual company shutdown between Christmas &amp; New Year&#39;s)

401k with company contribution

Annual learning &amp; development budget + access to LinkedIn Learning

Paid subscriptions to Headspace, Doordash, Sworkit, and other wellness apps

At Deep Silver Volition we believe in fostering an open, collaborative, and diverse environment, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We will consider all qualified applicants without attention to race, color, national origin, religion, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, genetic information, disability, age, veteran status, or military status.

                                    Gram Games is the studio behind some of the most popular mobile titles like 1010!, Six! and Merge Dragons!. We’ve recently released Merge Magic! and we have more awesome projects in the pipeline. We do things differently here: we work in small self-managing teams, enabling you to have an incredible amount of ownership, autonomy and impact. We&#39;ll never ask you to abandon your craft and just focus on managing others or workload.

At Gram everyone is expected to have a razor-sharp focus on what creates tangible impact: impact on their team, impact on their work environment and impact on the overall company strategy. If you are motivated by autonomy, constant improvement, collaboration and the sense of belonging this is the right job for you.

We are looking for a new member to join our QA team at Gram Games to ensure top quality testing standards and processes are employed for all our releases giving our players experiences they love. You will independently lead a team’s test strategy and lead the end-to-end testing of everything related to your team. Fully embedded, you’ll be a pillar of great practice and knowledge for junior internal QA staff. You’ll already have built a toolbox of manual functional testing skills to apply to new project challenges.

Come join us! You’ll find a dynamic and engaging culture while having the opportunity to be a key component in the delivery of major features for a franchise title.

Key Roles &amp; Responsibilities

Effective vendor use: Performing in-sprint component testing yourself and coordinating other tests to be run by your external vendor team. Set the standard for test estimations and coordination processes, knows what good internal &amp; external cohesion looks like and is confident at getting the most from vendor relationships.

Information, Reporting and Communication: Being adept at crafting tests that get the clearest results and then summarising that test data into useful, digestible, reports for the internal feature team to action. Knowing when an email report is more effective than an instant message and when a face-to-face is the way to go.

Decision making: Recognise the balance between quality and other business priorities; knowing the ROI of testing and how to navigate difficult project decisions.

Best Practice and Mentoring: Promoting QA best practices and running, mentoring and training for junior members of the internal and external QA teams. Represent QA during planning meetings and retrospectives.

About Ramen VR

Have you heard of Ready Player One? Well, we&#39;re building it for real people:

We&#39;re building the next reality featuring an infinite universe where millions of people can build new lives together in a gorgeous, cyberpunk and inspired world. We&#39;re starting with Zenith, a massively multiplayer online roleplaying game that is cross platform for VR, desktop, and console.

Ramen VR was started in early 2019 in the Bay Area by Andy and Lauren, gaming tech engineers with decades of combined experience at Google, Unity, OpenFeint, and some very successful mobile and social games.

We&#39;re funded by some of the best investors and gaming entrepreneurs in the world including YCombinator, The Makers Fund, Twitch COO Kevin Lin, and Kabam Cofounder Holly Liu and also the most successful VR Gaming Kickstarter of all time.

We believe great games change the world for the better. Great games inspire creativity, teach grit, and most importantly, build community.

Why Work At Ramen VR?

Create the next reality

Every startup claims they are changing the world. How often do you find one that&#39;s building an entirely new reality? Also, we&#39;re such a small team, that you&#39;ll be working from and learning directly from the founders every day.

We Love Games

Have a favorite game coming out? Take a day off on launch day. We&#39;ll even buy you the deluxe version of the game. Play the game, and just do a short write-up to teach us what you learned. Want to attend PAX or E3? Once a year, we&#39;ll schedule a corporate trip for anyone who wants to go and hang out, while working together.

Work Remotely

Need to walk the dog, take care of your kids, or just want to live where you are? Work remotely from anywhere in the world.

Company Game Jams

About once per quarter, travel somewhere in the world with us, and live in a big house together for a week, all expenses paid. Spend time working , playing games, exploring a new country, and growing together.

                                    SMG is looking for an experienced Unity game developer that wants to make awesome games across multiple platforms with strong prototyping strengths.

You must have an existing portfolio of games or prototypes you&#39;ve already made to be considered for this position.

You&#39;ll work as part of a team on a large project but a focus on the top of the funnel fun, unique, interesting game mechanics and ideas.

This can be a fulltime position or we&#39;ll work with the best part time. It&#39;s more about the output than the hours.

Who you are: a developer or game designer who loves making new things and can smell ‘fun’ from a nautical mile away. You can whip a prototype up and test an idea early and are comfortable in working in a collaborative idea space where constructive feedback is an important part of the creative process.

Our games: SP!NG, No Way Home, Moving Out, RISK, Death Squared, Thumb Drift, OTTTD, One More Line &amp; One More Dash

You will have the opportunity to work on high-profile IP as well as original IP.

What you will do

Create game prototypes (original ideas, and from briefs) to test gameplay ideas and mechanics.

A rapid prototyping mentality with a portfolio that demonstrates your prototyping savvy

A keen sense of game design.

A keen sense of gameplay mechanics.

Passion for game feel.

An eye for motion.

A team-player looking to collaborate and share

Ambitious use and embrace of new technologies

A passion for constantly making things better and mastering your craft.

                                    1047 Games began with the simple principle that people should have fun while making great games. Bucking convention and driven by a passion to create the ultimate gaming experience, Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian founded 1047 Games in 2017 in their Stanford dorm room. Their love for arena shooters of the past drove them to create Splitgate, a unique sci-fi first-person shooter that adds portal guns to upend the genre.

What started as two computer science majors putting portals into a first-person shooter for a project demo has evolved into a VC-backed company which has raised more than $120MM in funding.

At 1047 Games, you’ll find a permanently remote, dedicated team of top-tier talent from some of the world’s biggest gaming and tech companies who share our founders’ vision.

                                    About the team

The Security &amp; Privacy team at Wildlife is responsible for securing our player information, protecting our online games and services against attacks and reducing overall risk exposure. We solve this problem by implementing industry best practices, automation and strong relationships with software developers, infrastructure engineers and the IT team.

The team seeks to be a highly visible, responsive and effective team which enables the company to deliver against its strategic aims, by reducing the risk of significant security incidents and data breaches.

Wildlife’s Security &amp; Privacy department is divided in 4 different teams:

Application Security: They work with developers to set up security control measures during every stage of software development lifecycle. They also develop, implement and use tools and techniques to protect applications that have been deployed, by finding, preventing and/or correcting detected vulnerabilities.

Cloud Security: The team responsible for defining and enforcing security policies over our Infrastructure and Cloud Services, operated by public cloud providers, including but not limited to software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), and platform-as-a-service (PaaS).

Corporate Security: Responsible for the implementation and operation of tools and processes to secure our workstations, end-user devices, office hardware, services and office networks. The team works closely with all company areas to deliver security solutions that allow our world-wide workforce to deliver value in a secure manner.

Red Team: Wildlife’s offensive security team. Mainly responsible for planning, driving and/or conducting penetration tests, using the same techniques and tools of hackers to evade detection and test the defense readiness of the internal security team. This includes testing for not just vulnerabilities within the technology, but of the people within the organization as well.

About the role

Wildlife Studios is searching for an Application Security Manager, reporting to the Head of Security &amp; Privacy. This person will be responsible to lead, grow and mentor our Application Security team, responsible for:

Integrating security tools, standards, and processes into the software development life cycle

Ensuring that developers and engineers are trained with the appropriate level of security knowledge to perform their daily activities.

Improving and supporting application security tool deployments including static and dynamic code analysis and runtime testing tools.

Improving and maintaining secure development standards.

Supporting the incident response and architecture review processes whenever application security expertise is needed.

Defining and managing application framework and perimeter security improvement projects.

Ensure 3rd party software and development meets Wildlife’s security standards

Integrating threat modeling practices into the product life cycle.

Providing security requirements for test driven design.

Producing metrics reporting the state of application security programs and performance of development teams against requirements.

You will work together with developers and engineers to create amazing games and revolutionary mobile game monetization software that is secure for our customers. We integrate security early into the SDLC, leverage automation and help developers deliver value.

The security team works together with internal partners from the development and infrastructure areas in order to have a multiplying impact. All our workloads are deployed on the AWS cloud and Kubernetes clusters, our applications are cloud-native, focused on performance, scaling and security.

We&#39;ll need you to understand our applications, identify potential vulnerabilities, propose, design and implement solutions that will lower the overall risk. These solutions will often come as small programs we develop in-house, or implementations of third-party tools that require some glue code to work with our software build pipelines.

Since we are always looking for new tools and technologies that better solve our problems, we value professionals that like to learn new things, are autonomous and proactive to bring and implement their ideas.

More about you

Successful candidates will be security evangelists who can translate security concepts into language that is meaningful to many audiences, including business and technical leaders and individual contributors.

                                    About DECA Games

We believe that games should be played for decades but many are abandoned even when a loyal community is screaming to keep them alive. DECA specializes in acquiring games from other developers and reinvigorating them to continue to entertain for decades. When other studios see an old game, we see an amazing set of problems to solve and a huge opportunity.

DECA is a remote company with over 230 people in over 26 countries globally. DECA has been profitable since its inception in 2016. DECA is also a part of the Embracer Group, the largest public gaming company in Europe.

                                    Giant Squid is looking for a highly-skilled Senior Programmer to make core gameplay systems, engine features, and developer tools for our new exciting game project. We are looking for an experienced developer who really understands video games and is great at making them– a heavy hitter who can take on any kind of task and do what it takes to get it done right. Beyond being a virtuoso coder and great communicator, our ideal candidate is aligned with our goal of creating video game experiences that are elegant and efficient, yet evocative, beautiful and meaningful.

As a Senior Programmer, we will ask you to design, implement, maintain, and debug many features for our current UE5 game project. These will include gameplay systems, editor tools, and more. You will often work directly with technical artists and animators as well as the rest of our coder team to implement game features that require cross disciplinary collaboration.

Giant Squid is a small but seasoned team of award-winning game developers. The innovative and beautiful game experiences that we make spring from a team culture that is friendly, open, and inclusive. We are looking for a team player who fits right into close-knit small team development and shares our excitement for learning, wearing multiple hats, and stepping outside of regular workflows to make things happen.

This is a remote position, and we are a fully remote team. We operate mainly in the PST time zone and prefer that your location is in a time zone relatively close to ours.

Responsibilities

Design, implement, maintain, and debug large core game systems

Extend engine functionality in an efficient and sustainable way

Design and implement developer tools for art, level design and programming, incorporating team workflows

Optimize code and systems to bring game performance up to a shippable level of quality

Requirements

Wide breadth of game programming knowledge and experience (critical gameplay systems, world-building tools, shader programming, engine systems, etc...)

Deep understanding of mathematics for game systems (calculus, linear algebra, trigonometry, etc.)

Mastery of programming in C++ and working knowledge of many programming languages

A willingness to collaborate closely with artists

Knowledge of game design principles

At least one title shipped in a senior programmer role or equivalent experience

Bonus

Experience with Unreal Engine

Great, let&#39;s talk about ourselves quickly. We&#39;re ambitious game enthusiasts who are well prepared to both have fun and work hard. We aim high, but we do not lose ourselves in the pursuit of success and further achievements. We love to learn! And over the years in the industry, we have learned that the best games are created by qualified, rested, treated with respect game developers.

Importantly, our work culture has been built on the basis of specific, true (and respected by us) values. The most important of these is &#34;We never lie&#34;, so you can be sure that we have not overdone this announcement. We play by our own rules and we make games that we would like to play ourselves. We combine the game development world with best software delivery practices to make it more predictable and reliable. All this helps us to bring fun back to game development! Will you help us?

Where do we stand on diversity?

We hope to bring together a diverse team of people with various backgrounds and experiences, who will bring broader ideas, new perspectives, and different solutions to our table. Whoever you are, feel welcome and encouraged to apply.

Senior Gameplay Programmer

As a Senior Gameplay programmer on the Gameplay team in Bright Star Studios, you&#39;ll be part of the core group of developers that wants to deliver a one-of-a-kind gameplay experience for the players of Ember Sword. As a Senior your main responsibility is designing and building larger gameplay systems in Ember Sword as well as teaching and guiding junior programmers. If you are looking to have an impact on an ambitious MMORPG, then join us and pioneer solutions that will help us scale to the next level.

We are expanding with rocket speed, while being on our quest to make the next big MMORPG. Generally, building something from scratch should excite you rather than terrify you. Don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be doing this alone; throughout the last year our team grew by 125% and we have various backgrounds from companies such as Riot Games, Blizzard, Apple, Unity, Lucas Art, and more. We have plenty of ideas and we are looking for more talented people to help us fulfill them.

Responsibilities:

Working on gameplay features such as: items, social systems, progression, crafting, combat, to name a few.

Maintaining existing features in the game

Contributing fresh ideas to game design

As a Senior you&#39;ll also be responsible for coaching and mentoring junior programmers, within your domain.

About Bright Star Studios

We are crazy ambitious. That’s one of the reasons why Ember Sword is created on our own custom game engine. The game should be playable via a browser and it is a matter of seconds from you entering our site until you are ingame. If you want to play in another region, you don’t need to start from scratch. You’ll simply have all your gear, levels, and items with you - This means you can always play with your friends, regardless of what server you both started on. No more annoying scenarios where you have to make new characters or pay to move to another server. All your skins are owned by the players, not the gaming companies. All cosmetics are dropped in-game as free NFT’s, allowing the player to truly own it, and enables them to legally trade assets outside the game. Cosmetics have zero in-game advantages and you can not pay to win. It’s free to play and it’s a game by gamers, to gamers. We are able to proudly state that, as our team consists of former professional Counter-Strike and World of Warcraft players.

                                    Free Range Games grows games the old fashioned way: we don’t put our team in cages, we work distributedly, and we don’t use toxic work/life trade-offs. Some of our crafters have worked together from PS1 to PS5 and will tell you about carving games one triangle at a time from punch cards.

We are some of the folk behind Spider-man, Tony Hawk, Lord of the Rings, Twitch Sings, Oddworld, Shrek Super Slam, and dozens of mobile and web games. We believe every member of the team has a voice in what the game should be.

We prioritize community, family, and love-of-gaming over process, crunching, and TPS reports. And maybe that’s what you want too.

Free Range Games is looking for an engineer that has implemented the core mechanics of a good

3d action, fighting, or action sports title. Our unannounced title is based on deep, skill-based controls and next-gen animation - extreme action combined with combat. This is the forte of our studio, but this is a huge title, and we need someone who can own core gameplay mechanics.

Responsibilities:

Bring together physics, animation, controls and camera into one elegant system.
Craft that system into gameplay gold.
Delegate features and feature breadth to other gameplay coders.
Work with animators to create buttery locomotion with anim blends and tertiary motion.
Work with design on variations to the core based on equipment and environments.

Requirements:

Comp Sci or Math degree.
5+ years with a C variant.
Vector Math and Linear Algebra as first language.
Understand rigid body physics, constraints, joints.

                                    We&#39;re looking for an experienced Software Engineering Manager to join our team, which collaborates remotely from around the world. Our members range from industry newcomers to experts with 15+ years of experience. Team members come from a diverse set of backgrounds, but share a common passion for building polished player-focused, community-powered games.

At Hypixel Studios we are looking for applicants that are demonstrably passionate about their hobbies, have the drive and commitment to deliver results with minimal supervision, have international-level professional competency in their skill sets, and can demonstrate involvement with other interesting projects throughout their lives.

As a Software Engineering Manager for Hypixel, you will report to the studio’s Technical Director. You will be a key part of the engineering leadership team, and will have a direct impact on long-term, strategic technical direction. You will collaborate closely with all disciplines including Production, QA, Art, Audio, and Game Design to make far-reaching decisions that serve the whole studio.

At Hypixel, an Engineering Manager is a servant leader, who leverages their experience to organize, motivate, and develop engineers across a broad range of experience and roles: from individual contributors, to developing technical leaders, to engineers just beginning their journey into management. Managers are expected to lead with empathy and organizational acumen, combined with technical ability near that of the senior engineers on their teams. This will mean balancing a “lead by example” approach, as you get your hands dirty in the code, with working through your direct reports and other subject matter experts to scale your impact.

Who you are:

Player-focused: You understand what players want, and can help your team understand and meet those needs. Your player-focus serves as a common ground for your discussions with Game Design and other disciplines.
A collaborator: You are passionate about empowering artists and designers to realize their ideas in-game with minimal engineering assistance. You want to work elbow-to-elbow with them to listen to them to understand their needs, and you bring that customer-focus to your team.
Curious: No one knows everything, so asking insightful questions and listening to the answers will be key to rapidly learning about our technology, our product, and our team.
Calm under pressure: You exude calm in even the toughest of situations. When things get spicy, you work as a cooler to help the team reach a solution.
A force multiplier: You understand how to organize a team to operate effectively, remove blockers, and make the most of everyone’s skills and passions. You understand how to empower engineers on your team to learn, grow, and scale.
Obsessed with improvement: Inefficiency bothers you and you work to create well-oiled processes and systems whenever you can.
Adaptable: You understand the need for rapid re-prioritization, and are able to build resiliency in yourself and others to meet the challenges such re-prioritization creates.

Some of your role:

Manage 3 to 10 engineers as direct reports, working across 1 to 3 cross-functional teams
Foster a healthy engineering culture through developing best practices and modeling servant leadership
Organize and evolve teams to meet the changing needs of the Studio as the game goes through a full development lifecycle
Develop roles and expectations for your team members
Coach and mentor individual contributor engineers, tech leads, and new engineering managers
Maintain high traction conversation on engineering morale and delivery status through team meetings and one-on-ones
Provide technical leadership through designs, code, and insightful questions
Build frameworks to shape technical decision-making such as design processes, architectural direction-setting, and software selection, etc
Work with producers to develop product plans and roadmaps
Collaborate closely with designers and artists to understand game system and tools requirements
Assist senior engineers in turning requirements into systems designs
Help engineers break down product requirements into manageable tasks, estimate those tasks, prioritize them, and execute them

Essential Traits:

3+ years experience managing software development teams.
5+ years experience in professional software development as a hands-on developer
2+ years working in a game engine (Unity, Unreal, Proprietary/In-House, etc.).
Experience mentoring team members towards reaching their career goals.
Strong experience with software development processes, such as Agile/Scrum, Kanban/Lean, and Critical Path/Waterfall, and a clear understanding of the value they bring to team health and value delivery
OO Development experience in C#, C++, Java, etc.
Experience with Source Control tools such as Git and Perforce

Bonus Traits:

Experience with one or more of the following game systems:
Networked, multiplayer game engineering
Gameplay systems
Creating game developer Tools
Game asset pipelines and build pipelines
Continuous Integration &amp; Delivery
Rendering
Game AI
Game engine architecture
Game engine internals
Professional C++ engineering experience
Experience across multiple stages of the game development lifecycle (e.g., Prototype, Pre-Production, Production, Live Operations)
Experience modding games
Experience with User Generated Content (UGC)
A personal passion for open world, builder, or survival games.

We can offer:

A chance to work on a new game project with an extremely motivated team
Opportunities to learn and grow personally and professionally
A stable and secure work environment
The ability to work remotely

                                    At Arkadium our purpose is to have fun while creating fun - and that’s exactly what we’ve been doing for 20 years.

We’re the creators behind the world’s most-played games. From the Solitaire that came on your Windows machine, to hundreds of other games you’ve come to know and love - you can find our games on Arkadium.com, iOS, Android, and lots of other big sites worldwide.

As a proud Evergreen business our values of Fierce Drive, Positive Energy and Living Full Lives are the driving force behind how we run and the choices we make.

We’re privately held (aka stable and reasonable about growth), founder-led (aka passionate about our craft) and we consistently rank as a “Best Place to Work” (aka not your typical games company).

Interested in working with us? We’d love to hear from you.

This is a contract role with the potential to transition to a permanent position. This role is 100% remote and is open to candidates based in Romania. Business hours are 10am to 7pm in Romania.

implement security best practices and standards;

reduce attack surface for applications and infrastructure;

maintain operational docs and DR plans in actual state.

You will:

introduce new technologies and automate processes;

work with a dynamically changing infrastructure in the environment of IT Pro – developers, analytics, data engineers, QA;

build enjoyable products! We’re constantly improving and automating infrastructure to reliable deliver our services (and reduce boring routines).

Requirements

Our ideal candidate:

understands computer networks and web applications;

have experience with heterogenous environments (Linux, Cloud, Windows);

Web servers (nginx or any other)

Configuration management systems/IaC

Web app debugging (Chrome DevTools, cURL);

Assessing the impact of potential improvements or changes on the game

Drive product quality, regularly reviewing the game and providing constructive, thoughtful feedback to the team.

Inform and guide the team with a detailed understanding of risks, dependencies, and resource constraints. Identify potential areas of risk, create/execute mitigation plans before issues happen, and keep the team running at a high level of productivity.

Facilitate communication across the project team; clearly communicate tasks and responsibilities to staff. Act as primary problem solver, resolving conflicts before they impact production and productivity.

Partner with Project Managers to deliver and refine the project roadmap. Participate in Scrum team ceremonies, including daily standups, sprint planning, backlog grooming and retros.

Track bugs and triage regularly with your team, assessing, assigning, and prioritizing according to sprint and project needs.

Develop and share game industry best practices for product management, team communication, LiveOps, road mapping and business strategies.

Define, implement, and evolve team processes that foster collaboration, open feedback, and individual initiative.

Be a champion for a healthy team culture that rejects crunch while supporting each other to carry out ambitious goals.

Craft clear, detailed, and proactive communication to your immediate group and our studio leadership team.

What we’re looking for:

8+ years&#39; experience in game development production.

Full project life cycle experience as an internal game producer, with at least 3 shipped AAA game titles.

4+ years&#39; experience as a trusted and inspiring manager and motivator, with high EQ and low ego.

Comprehensive understanding of agile methodologies, project management tools, and game development life cycle.

Empathetic collaboration style, with an ability to articulate the &#34;why&#34; instead of just the &#34;how&#34; and &#34;what&#34; to ensure developers apply insights for future features.

Persuasive and effective communication skills, with proven experience in diplomatically and effectively negotiating efficient solutions across cross-functional teams.

A resourceful and adaptive entrepreneurial spirit, with a bias for action.

Strong intellectual curiosity, willing to embrace experimentation and invite open participation in creative problem-solving.

A servant leader mindset, with a passion for enabling creative people to do their best work.

Some of our benefits:

Subsidized medical/dental/vision insurance

A Little More About Kwalee

Founded in 2011 by David Darling CBE, a key architect of the UK games industry who previously co-founded and led Codemasters, our team also includes legends such as Andrew Graham (creator of Micro Machines series) and Jason Falcus (programmer of classics including NBA Jam) alongside a growing and diverse team of global gaming experts.

Everyone contributes creatively to Kwalee’s success, with all employees eligible to pitch their own game ideas on Creative Wednesdays, and we’re proud to have built our success on this inclusive principle.

We have an amazing team of experts collaborating daily between our studios in Leamington Spa, Lisbon, Bangalore and Beijing, or on a remote basis from Turkey, Brazil, Cyprus, the Philippines and many more places around the world. We’ve recently acquired our first external studio, TicTales, which is based in France.

We have a truly global team making games for a global audience, and it’s paying off: - Kwalee has been voted the Best Large Studio and Best Leadership Team at the TIGA Awards (Independent Game Developers’ Association) and our games have been downloaded in every country on earth - including Antarctica!

Delivering clear, concise, and thorough specifications to cross functional teams responsible for implementing these systems.

Providing team members with direction on how content should be created, tuned, and live operated within these systems.

You will become an expert in the opportunity spaces, genres, and game mechanics you explore during prototyping and share your learnings with the broader product team to advance our collective knowledge.

You will develop an independent design philosophy that upholds the key tenets of Fortis’ approach to products while adding your own unique approach to thinking about emerging patterns in service design.​

What you’ll need to be successful

A holistic view of game systems and the downstream effects of all design decisions throughout both the product and player lifecycle.

A firm understanding of fundamental design principles, metagame systems, game economies, and player psychology that allows you to design from first principles.

Ability to articulate the nuances of abstract concepts and how they apply to complex, interrelated systems.

Ability to synthesize feedback from team members, user playtests, and other validation efforts into product insights and rapidly iterate on designs.

Extensive knowledge of games as a service and live operations – you know what good looks like and can build efficient design processes, workflows, and tooling to enable it.

Enthusiasm for directing, mentoring, and otherwise elevating the people around you to do their best work.

A natural curiosity and eagerness to learn - we believe this is essential to our ability to stay ahead of the market and value this over years of experience.​

We’re using Codecks for task planning and have weekly team voice calls on Discord.

Location requirements:

We have a fully remote team, and we all work during the times that suit us best. We do try and synchronise rough core hours for team communication but some team members choose to work half days and others to only work certain days each week so we do our best to make sure everyone is accommodated. We will also be having monthly, but optional, team meets in London.
